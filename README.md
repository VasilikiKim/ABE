## Attribute-based Encryption Schemes 
 implemented by JPBC library.  [see PBC Library](https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/)
1. gpswabe, the first Key-Policy Attribute-based Encryption comes from the paper： Attribute-based encryption for fine-grained access control of encrypted data [see paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1180405.1180418)
2. swabe, a Cipher-Policy Attribute-based Encryption comes from the paper: Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption [see paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4223236)
3. rwabe, a large-universe Cipher-Policy Attribute-based Encryption comes from the paper: Practical constructions and new proof methods for large universe attribute-based encryption [see paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2508859.2516672)
4. rwodabe, rwabe with outsourcing decryption function, designed by me. [Reference ](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec11/tech/full_papers/Green.pdf)
